# Adaptive-Isogeometric-Analysis-using-optimal-transport-and-their-fast-solvers
We devise fast solvers and adaptive mesh generation procedures based on the Monge–Ampère Equation using B-Splines Finite Elements, within the Isogeometric Analysis framework
**We use Pyccel and kronecker algebra accelerated with Pyccel for a fast calculus.**

For your analysis You can find and install the following packages from the url

**For simpline** :

**For Pyccel** : 

              https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel

**For kronecker** :

**We implement a code based on fast diagonalization, see the document in the other branch (click on main).** :
